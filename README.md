# Coffee Listing Challenge

This project is a solution to the [DevChallenges.io Coffee Listing Challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/simple-coffee-listing), built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## Overview

In this challenge, the goal is to create a reusable card component to display a list of coffee products. The application fetches data from a remote API and displays the coffee items with specific details, such as the name, image, price, rating, votes, and availability. Users can filter the coffee list to show only available products.

## Features

- **Reusable Card Component**: Displays coffee details including image, name, price, rating, and votes.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Renders availability status and popular tags based on coffee data.
- **Fetch Data**: Retrieves coffee data from a remote JSON API.
- **Product Filtering**: Option to view all products or only available ones.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive layout.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Front-end library to build the interactive components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the app.
- **Fetch API**: To fetch coffee data from a remote JSON file.
